## Crop Demo Final Summary

This document provides a textual summary of the contents and purpose of the `crop_demo_final` folder.

### Overview

The `crop_demo_final` folder contains a demonstration of the HawkEYE Crop Intelligence Engine. This demo showcases an end-to-end workflow for identifying crop stress in the Jessore region of Bangladesh using self-supervised learning and unsupervised clustering on satellite imagery.

### Folder Structure

- **`crop_demo_assets/`**: Contains visual assets generated by the demo, including:
  - `jessore_rgb_preview.png`: An RGB image of the area of interest.
  - `jessore_stress_overlay.png`: An image showing the identified crop stress areas overlaid on the RGB preview.
  - `charts/crop_explainer_grid.png`: A 2x2 grid visualizing the analysis process.
- **`crop_demo_data_processed/`**: Contains the final processed `stress_map.npy` file.
- **`crop_demo_data_raw/`**: Contains the raw, multi-modal satellite data (`multimodal_jessore.npy`).
- **`crop_demo_models/`**: Stores the trained self-supervised backbone model (`crop_ssl_backbone.pt`).
- **`generate_crop_explainer.py`**: A Python script to generate the `crop_explainer_grid.png`.
- **`model_report_crop_ultimate.json`**: A JSON file containing a summary of the model's results.
- **`run_corrected_crop_demo.py`**: The main Python script that executes the entire crop stress analysis pipeline.

### Model Report Summary (`model_report_crop_ultimate.json`)

The model report provides a high-level summary of the analysis:
- **Model**: HawkEYE Crop Intelligence Engine (hawkeye-crop-v1)
- **Objective**: Identify hidden crop stress patterns from raw satellite data using self-supervised AI.
- **Key Results**:
  - **Estimated Stressed Area**: 8.27%
  - **Clusters Identified**: 4
  - **Key Insight**: The model successfully identified significant areas of potential crop stress.

### Python Scripts

1.  **`run_corrected_crop_demo.py`**:
    - **Purpose**: This is the main script that orchestrates the entire demo.
    - **Workflow**:
      1.  **Data Acquisition**: Pulls Sentinel-2 and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from Google Earth Engine for the Jessore region.
      2.  **Self-Supervised Learning**: Trains a simple backbone model using SimSiam on image tiles to learn features from the data without labels.
      3.  **Unsupervised Clustering**: Uses K-Means clustering on vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI) and other features to identify 4 distinct clusters, one of which represents crop stress.
      4.  **Report Generation**: Generates the `model_report_crop_ultimate.json` and visual assets.

2.  **`generate_crop_explainer.py`**:
    - **Purpose**: This script generates a visual summary of the analysis process.
    - **Output**: Creates a 2x2 grid image (`crop_explainer_grid.png`) that shows:
      1.  The true-color satellite view.
      2.  The calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
      3.  The calculated Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).
      4.  The final AI-discovered stress map.

### Key Assets

- **`stress_map.npy`**: The final output of the analysis, a NumPy array representing the crop stress map.
- **`jessore_stress_overlay.png`**: A human-readable visualization of the `stress_map.npy` overlaid on the RGB image.
- **`model_report_crop_ultimate.json`**: The primary textual output summarizing the findings.
