## Final Flourish Summary

This document provides a textual summary of the contents and purpose of the `final flourish` folder.

### Overview

The `final flourish` folder contains a comprehensive project focused on dengue forecasting in Dhaka, Bangladesh, referred to as "HawkEye Omega." It integrates various data sources, including public health data, weather, satellite imagery, and economic indicators, to analyze and predict dengue outbreaks. The project exists in at least two versions, with `v4` being the latest and most robust.

### Folder Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the core data for the project.
  - **`processed/`**: Cleaned and processed CSV files ready for analysis (dengue cases, population, weather, nightlights).
  - **`raw/`**: A large collection of raw data files, including PDF reports on dengue, census data, and various economic and environmental datasets.
- **`reports/` and `reports_v4/`**: These folders contain the outputs of the analysis. `reports_v4` contains the outputs of the latest version of the script.
  - **`figures/`**: Contains generated images, such as dashboards and satellite imagery visualizations.
  - **`hawkeye_v4_analysis_report.json`**: The main JSON output of the `v4` analysis, containing a wealth of structured data.
- **`scripts/`**: A collection of Python and PowerShell scripts for data processing, including scripts for downloading and extracting data from dengue PDF reports.
- **`run_hawkeye_omega_corrected.py` and `run_hawkeye_omega_v4_corrected.py`**: The main Python scripts for running the analysis. The `v4` script is the most recent and functional.
- **`DATASET_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`**: A detailed markdown file that provides a comprehensive overview of the entire `MyNewProject` workspace, not just the `final flourish` folder.

### Key Documents and Scripts

1.  **`hawkeye_v4_analysis_report.json`**: This is the primary output of the project. It is a detailed JSON file containing:
    - Metadata about the analysis.
    - A summary of the data used.
    - Correlation analysis between dengue cases and various factors (weather, economic).
    - Detailed statistics on disease trends, weather, etc.
    - A 14-day forecast of dengue cases.
    - Satellite data analysis (nightlight radiance as an economic proxy).
    - Economic impact calculations.
    - Key findings and limitations.

2.  **`DATASET_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`**: This document provides a high-level overview of all the projects within the `MyNewProject` workspace. It details the purpose, technology, and status of each project, and also contains important information like API keys and project IDs.

3.  **`run_hawkeye_omega_v4_corrected.py`**: This is the main script for the `v4` analysis. It is a well-structured and pragmatic script that:
    - Loads and processes all available data.
    - Fetches live weather data.
    - Performs statistical analysis and generates a simple forecast.
    - Calculates economic impacts.
    - Integrates with Google Earth Engine for satellite data.
    - Generates the final JSON report and a visual dashboard.

### Summary of Findings (from `hawkeye_v4_analysis_report.json`)

- **Disease Trend**: The trend of dengue cases is actively monitored and reported as either "increasing" or "decreasing."
- **Correlations**: Significant correlations have been found between dengue cases and both temperature and economic factors.
- **Economic Impact**: The report includes calculations of the economic burden of dengue, including healthcare costs and productivity loss.
- **Forecasting**: A simple, trend-based 14-day forecast is provided, with a note on its high uncertainty.
- **Satellite Analysis**: Nightlight radiance data is used as a proxy for economic activity, and its trend is analyzed.
